﻿﻿## SpatialKey Software Engineer, Front End - Interview Exercise

Kathy is an Underwriter.  Her job is to assess the risk of a given location, along with other factors, to make decisions about pricing policies. Typically she is only given the address of a location and must manually cross-reference an address against different Risk Modelers maps, one by one, to determine the level of risk. This is done in the browser and across different websites for each Risk Modeler. Since each Risk Modeler has their own methodology for determining the risk, she likes to view the results side by side for comparison, so she copies her findings into a spreadsheet. She also likes to see where the location is on the map to gain confidence in the results.

You are tasked with unifying Kathy’s current process into a single page application.

## What's Included:

* You may extend the functionality of these api calls to be more dynamic and/or include additional results
* The values Kathy needs to compare are:
    * sk_risk_fema (For FEMA)
    * sk_risk_katrisk (For KatRisk)
